This is an algorithm that will never let you win in [tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). The runner.py file is taken from [CS50's AI Tic Tac Toe project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/0/tictactoe/). My custom code is in tictactoe.py(cs50 instructed me on which function should do, but I came up with the logic myself) and tests.py(simple assertion statements to confirm my functions worked as intended). [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)'s runner.py and the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/) build the GUI to play the game.
